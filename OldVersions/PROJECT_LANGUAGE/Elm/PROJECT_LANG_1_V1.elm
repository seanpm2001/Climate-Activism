-- About:
-- I decided to make Elm the main (first) project language for this project (seanpm2001/Climate-Activism) as this project is purely documentation, but I didn't feel that Markdown was a significant enough language to represent this project. I wanted to represent it with a nature themed language, and I don't use Elm very much, so I chose it as the main project language file for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
