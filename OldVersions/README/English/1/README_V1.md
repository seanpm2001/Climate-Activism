# Climate activism

**Assigned to:** `(seanpm2001) Green Team`

Alongside my usual development (blue team) I have a green team, which focuses on environmental aspects. I am not a full-time climate activist, but I am not a climate slacktivist either. This article will go over my efforts to help with keeping the planet healthy.

## Positions on climate that I deal with

### Anti-Planned obsolescence 

> Examples: Computing longevity, other

* [Computing longevity](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Computing-Longevity/) Link is coming soon, as of 2023, Friday, January 20th

> [Hardware longevity](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Hardware-Longevity/) Link is coming soon, as of 2023, Friday, January 20th

> [Software longevity](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Software-Longevity/) Link is coming soon, as of 2023, Friday, January 20th

> [Computing longevity blog](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Computing-longevity-blog/)

> **Note** I used to have a GitHub pages site for this, but GitHub forced me to delete it. Starting with my renewed efforts, I am going to revive this project with the salvaged documentation from the original GitHub Pages site.

**What this helps with:**

- [x] Less electronic waste in landfills
- [x] Better usability of the device
- [x] Better experience for the user
- [x] Less CO2 from the factories producing the hardware
- [x] Limiting/ending global warming

### Going all electric

> Going all electric and refusing to use oil, gasoline, or petroleum

> Example: this is the reason why I don't drive yet, I require a full electric car, also free of proprietary software)

**What this helps with:**

- [x] CO2 reduction
- [x] Less oil drilling
- [x] Decreasing the worlds dependency on oil, gasoline, and petroleum

### Preventing deforestation and desertification

> Anti-deforestation (not very public on this one) I believe that for every tree that is cut down, at least 3 healthy trees should be planted in a condition where they can survive and thrive

**What this helps with:**

- [x] Helping end the war on nature
- [x] More oxygen production for the planet
- [x] Less CO2
- [x] Protecting endangered species
- [x] Protecting species
- [x] Limiting/ending global warming

### Cryptocurrency experiment

A possible solution to the cryptocurrency mining environmental problem (currently just a theory)

- Having the cryptocurrency miners operate outside the Earths orbit (at least 10000 kilometers (6213.712 miles) from the exosphere) and additionally not on another planet, minor or major, moon or ring, especially one that may sustain life

**What this should do:**

- [x] Prevent excess CO2 from entering the Earths atmosphere, instead, floating around and dissipating in outer space

**Problems**

- [ ] Very, very costly, not yet economically feasible, and possibly scientifically impossible (with 2023 technology)
- [ ] At the moment, it would be better to just not mine cryptocurrency

> **Note** More research needs to be done on this

Additionally, I don't use or mine cryptocurrency

### Using environmentally friendly services

This is still a work in progress, right now, carbon negative services I use include:

- [x] DuckDuckGo
- [ ] This list is short and incomplete

> **Note** I am planning on doing more

## New inspirations

### Greta Thunberg

| Greta Thunberg being carried away by German police. Quickly released with no charges, and the cops were nice about it, but were legally required to do this. They likely didn't even want to do this. |

Greta Thunbergs coal mine protest in Germany (2023, January) inspired me to put more focus on environmentalism. Her fight seems so hopeless right now, and I feel really bad about it, so I am joining the fight, as the more people who join the fight, the less hopeless it will become, and the more progress will be made.
